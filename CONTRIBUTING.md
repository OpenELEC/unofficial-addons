# Contributing Guide Lines

Here is some guide lines for how you should add your addons to the un-official addons repo for OpenELEC.


### Pull Requests

- **Create topic branches**. Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature**. If you want to do more than one thing, send
  multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history**. Make sure each individual commit in your pull
  request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while
  developing, please squash them before sending them to us.

Please follow this process; it's the best way to get your work included in the project:

- [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

```bash
   # clone your fork of the repo into the current directory in terminal
   git clone git@github.com:<your username>/unofficial-addons.git
   # navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd unofficial-addons
   # assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/OpenELEC/unofficial-addons.git
   ```

- If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   # fetch upstream changes
   git fetch upstream
   # make sure you are on your 'master' branch
   git checkout master
   # merge upstream changes
   git merge upstream/master
   ```

- Create a new topic branch to contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

- Commit your changes in logical chunks. or your pull request is unlikely
   be merged into the main project. Use git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

- Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

- [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) with a
    clear title and description.
