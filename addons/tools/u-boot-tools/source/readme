This addon can make your device unusable if improperly configured!!! Use at your own risk.
This is an unofficial addon. Please don't ask for support in openelec forum / irc channel.

THIS IS COMMAND LINE ONLY ADDON.

Usage of fw_printenv and fw_setenv requires proper configuration. Never ever try to use
fw_setenv when fw_printenv will prints any error(something like bad checksum etc.) at start 
of its output - if you do it there is a big change to brick your device. Unbricking may require
access to device serial console, which may not be directly available on your device and may 
require soldering of proper pins on the device and USB-TTL adapter!!!

fw_printenv and fw_setenv needs configuration file to be located in
/storage/.kodi/userdata/addon_data/tools.u-boot-tools/fw_env.config 
example configuaration can be found in /storage/.kodi/addons/tools.u-boot-tools/fw_env.config

Addon may requre reboot to work properly

example for my Amlogic M8N device:
/dev/mtd1		0x100000		0x10000	0x10000
